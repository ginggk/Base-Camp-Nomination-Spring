# Instructions

First, the client lands on the **home** page. It has a few details about what Base Camp Coding Academy does, also the class of 2019's class picture.

Next, if the client is a student, they would want to go to the **apply** page on the nav-bar. That page has the welcome and then goes into the questions. These are questions about the student to see if they are a right fit. It asks for their name, then goes into some essay questions. When they submit their application, it takes them to an application page that shows them some resources they can watch before coming in for an interview. 

However, if they are an administrator, they would want to go to the **interview** page on the nav-bar. The interview page has an option for them to sort it in a certain way. They then can click on a certain student, and that shows the applicant's **detail** page. The student's detail shows their name, and all of their answers to the questions. It is laid out so it is easy to see for the administrator and can be easily accessed. 

The user can also go manually to the **resources** page to see all of the resources. 

You can also easily view it on a mobile phone.
